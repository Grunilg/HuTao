Hu Tao is a Genshin Impact discord bot. An invite link for this bot can be found [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=826550363355086918&scope=bot&permissions=319552).

## Permissions Required
Please make sure the bot has these permissions inside the channels you want to use the bot. 
- **Send/Receive Messages**: Needed to actually receive and respond to commands.
- **Manage Messages**: Used to delete reactions of others after clicking them, improves user experience by making it easier to click on it again.
- **Attach Files** / **Embed Links**: Used to send embeds, as well as display forum links.
- **Add Reactions**: Used to add reactions on own messages that users can click on.
- **Use External Emoji**: Used in character/weapon menu to indicate mora/items/element/weapon type/...

**TIP**: You can check if these are given with `ht!help`. In case one is missing, it'll be shown in a bold **NOTE** at the end of the message.

## Commands
The bot command prefix is `ht!`. Help for a specific command can be retrieved via `ht!help <command>`.

Every reply to commands will include an ‚ùå reaction, users can click this reaction to remove the bot post. This allows users to clean up in case something wasn't relevant to the conversation/reduce spam.

To improve usability, most commands that search stuff are fuzzy search. This means you can make a typo, or shorten the heck out of their names. (As of time of writing, `glad` matches `Gladiator's Finale`, `CW` matches `Crimson Witch of Flames`, `amus` matches `Amos' Bow`)

### Characters
- `ht!character`: Displays [a list of all characters](https://i.imgur.com/TdUS701.png). 
    - This command supports filtering such as element type (like `ht!c -pyro`), weapon type (like `ht!c -polearm`) and/or stars (like `ht!c -5*`). [Example](https://i.imgur.com/OB6Fhz0.png)
- `ht!character <name>`: Displays character information, such as [basic data](https://i.imgur.com/mtKqXOR.png) / [meta data](https://i.imgur.com/tYZdMLM.png) / [ascensions + stats](https://i.imgur.com/COQQwbZ.png) / [talent costs](https://i.imgur.com/9FKcdom.png) / [talents](https://i.imgur.com/nJjAbhQ.png) / [passives](https://i.imgur.com/dFZ70km.png) / [constellations](https://i.imgur.com/GiXH0N8.png) / [art](https://i.imgur.com/DwcdR4R.png).
    - See links for examples, reactions will correspond to directly skipping to that section. These can also be triggered directly via the command like `ht!c Hu Tao -art`.
    - Search is fuzzy, meaning `ht!c HT` *should* match Hu Tao as long as there's no other character being introduced that becomes a closer match.
